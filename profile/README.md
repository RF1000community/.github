## Hi there 👋

Please note, the RF1000community Github organisation is no longer connected to the rf1000.de forums. We are still open for contributions, bug reports etc. by anyone obeying the netiquette.

Unfortunately, the old Repetier-based firmware is hard to maintain, hence likely nobody will deal with bug reports there. All development effort (the little effort which is still spent here) shall
go into the Klipper-based firmware.

Feel free to open discussions if you want to get in touch. Don't hesitate to write in German.

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
